% script for running all relevant (preferrably non computationally
% intensive) analyzes related to the kruppel/eve2 data. Saves results in
% fig folder under some project name (have if (true/false) at beginning of
% each analysis so it's easy to decide which ones to use)

% scatter plot of eve2 off times, projects color coded result back onto
% nuclei (just some frame in the middle of nc14?)


% scatter plot of kruppel concentration at off times, projects color
% coded result back onto nuclei (useful for checking if it's possible to
% confuse posterior/anterior results)

% scatter plots instantaneous kruppel vs eve2 concentration with some delay
% of eve2
